10,furnished beautiful garden duplex in brownstone 3BR/BA,"
 We are the owners of a beautiful brownstone in Bushwick. We live in the ground floor apartment, a duplex with 3 bathrooms, 3 bedrooms, a backyard, washer/dryer, and a huge kitchen. We plan to travel for the next few years (indefinitely) and so are looking to sublet our apartment. We would treat it as a standard rental agreement, except that all utilities are included for a $300 monthly fee (gas, water, electric, heat, tv, wireless internet, local phone, and alarm system!) The space will be furnished with the basics. Across the street is a park so there is lots of light coming in both sides of the apartment. The neighbors are all very friendly and it is generally a quiet block nearest the J train and the B52 but also a reasonable walk to the L. We would be interested in signing a lease of 1 year. We will require proof of income, $3200 security deposit, and additional pet deposit (pets approved on a case by case basis.) Please no brokers or other solicitations in response to this ad/post. Thanks! Available March 1st.

 This sprawling, tastefully renovated 2 Bedroom Bed Stuy Apartment located 5 blocks from the Ralph C, 5 blocks from the Halsey J and 7 blocks from the Utica Ave A/C is rife with large bright windows on the top floor of a 2 floor building. It can easily be used as a 3 Bedroom though the common space near the kitchen, while more than adequate for a living room arrangement, is less sizable than the other possible common space, and one roommate would end up with the biggest bedroom I`ve ever seen in NYC. It`s surrounded by a vast selection of restaurants, nightlife and shopping of all sorts. Personal favorites include Peaches Modern Comfort Food &amp; Therapy Wine Bar.
The particulars...
&bull; Lovely new wood floors and new paint
&bull; Brand new Appliances including DISHWASHER
&bull; 2 nearly identical, sizable Bedrooms w/ big bright windows. No arguments over the good one.
&bull; Unusually MASSIVE Living Room with tons of natural light &amp; closets. Break out the sectionals.

249,Gorgeous prewar 3-BR w/ heat  hot H2O incl Nostran A/C right there,"
 Hey!
This is an awesome apartment located on the 3rd floor of a walk-up, prewar building. Loads of cool details. The neighborhood is awesome! Tons of bars and restaurants to walk to on Franklin Ave and Lewis Ave and very close to the Nostrand A/C trains!
One of the bedrooms is railroaded, but there are multiple entrances to the apartment. If you don`t know what ""railroaded"" means, it means you have to walk through that room from the front bedroom to access the rest of the apartment. However, the front bedroom has a door to the hallway, so you can go around through the hallway to the other front door of the apartment. Not the most ideal for 3 roommates, but I`ve seen a lot of people make it work nicely.
The Details:
-Heat+hot water included
-Pets OK
-No Fee
-First/Security only
-3 queen-sized bedrooms - one is railroaded, but there are 2 entrances to the apartment and a separate kitchen and living room.
-1 bathroom
-Separate kitchen and living room
-Hardwood floors
-Moments to Nostrand A/C express trains = 20 minutes to West 4th Street.
-Move in ASAP
-Lease price is $2,700 with one month free on 15 month lease...with net of $2,520

 Lets hope it`s still available by the time you reach me LoL
That being said I too would be skeptical that this is legit.
BUT IT IS
Just for fun I`m going to tell you a little about park slope
(which I`m sure you know all about). But did you know that Anne Hathoway lives nearby?
The streets a beautiful quiet and serene. Local shops are filled with the highest quality goods and produce. People walk their dogs and drink their coffees and think to themselves ""how did I get so lucky?""
The apartment you will be residing in is not one of those over priced cheap flashy renovations. It`s charming with lots of character and filled with natural light. boasting plenty of living space on top of the master and guest bedroom which is still a very good size. I may even take you up on the offer and be your first guest.

693,True 4br in Park Slope,"
 Beautiful TRUE 4br/1ba in Park Slope at 5th and Union. Available March 15. NO BROKER FEE, WE AREN`T BROKERS WE JUST NEED TO RENT THIS APARTMENT. I don`t believe the landlord has any sort of application fee, but I will confirm that.
Location: heart of park slope at 5th and Union. One block from the R Union stop and a short walk to the trains at Barclays Center. Surrounded by amenities. Location speaks for itself.
Building: three story walk-up. Recently gut renovated. There are three other units in the building and shops at ground level.
Unit: four bedrooms all with their own windows (a true four bedroom). All the rooms can fit queen sized beds. The beds shown in the photos are all full-sized; a queen won`t fit sideways in most of them. ALL the rooms have good sized closets. High ceilings. Most of the rooms are recently painted. Ceiling fan in the living room. Gas heat/stove/oven. Good water pressure. Toilet was recently rebuilt (all new parts inside). There is no ""master bedroom"" so everyone has a fair space.
The Deal: we have lived here for nearly three years and will be moving on. In order to let us out of our month-to-month lease (without giving 60 days notice), our LL wants us to find people to take over the unit. So, you should be prepared to prove income (typically a salary equal to 40x the monthly rent), bank statements, credit, etc.

797,Unreal Deal on Williamsburg 3BR off Marcy J/M  NO Fee ,"
 This bright and beautiful 3 Bedroom Apartment located on Roebling St is just two blocks from the Marcy J stop, or put another way, 1 stop from Manhattan. The neighborhood is so well known it requires no description, suffice it to say that it`s surrounded on all sides by incredible Williamsburg restaurants, nightlife and shopping of all sorts. For newcomers to NY, it`s the most sought after part of Brooklyn. It`s also about a 10 minute walk to the Bedford L on those days when there are scheduled service changes. Commute to Manhattan in less than 10 minutes including walk time. Room for room, this is the most reasonably priced apartment I`ve seen in Williamsburg proper in recent memory.

890,Nice, newly redone 2 BD apt in great Lefferts Gardens location,"
 We`re looking for reliable tenants for a really nice, newly redone 2 bedroom in a terrific location in up and coming Prospect Lefferts Gardens. It`s available March 1st (can move in a few days early as it is vacant) -- it`s on the first floor of a quiet, 2 floor building with 4 units.
It`s a close walk to Prospect Park and the Botanical Gardens, and there are a lot of cafes, bars, restaurants, markets and a big CVS all right nearby, with new businesses opening up all the time. Including Gratitude Cafe (2 blocks away), Midwood Flats (4 blocks away), Bluebird Cafe (4 blocks away) and many, many others.
- No broker fee - we are the owners of the building
- 1 year lease (can be flexible in certain situations)
- First month and security deposit required
- Heat and hot water included
- New hardwood floors in the bedrooms
- The bedrooms are each 10` by 13.5` feet so a pretty good size.
- Entire apartment just repainted
- The kitchen and bathrooms are newly done - new stainless steel refrigerator on the way, new tiling, etc.
- Small pets accepted
Convenient to the subways - it`s a few blocks away from the 2/5 sterling street stop as well as the 2/5 winthrop stop (it`s in between the two) and about a 10-15 minute walk from the Prospect Park B/Q station. About 30 mins to lower Manhattan, 40 mins to midtown.

Me:
I`m a 32 year old Chef who works in Manhattan. I`m hardly ever home which is great for you; you`ll effectively be living by yourself five days a week. I leave the house early, get home late and don`t do much during the week. I keep pretty busy on the weekends but you might catch me in the kitchen or on the couch with a press pot, if I`m not out spending my hard earned money.
My ideal roommate would be a respectful, considerate and thoughtful housemate. Requesting that you be clean, reasonably quiet late at night, pay rent on time, contribute, etc. should go without saying. If it doesn`t, this might not be the living right situation for you.
To move in you will need:
-first and security = $2750
-sign-on for a one year commitment
-prepared to split the bills: Cable (negotiable), Con Ed, National Grid
Open house:
Please email or call 917-921-3263 to make an appointment, leave a voicemail or text message if I don`t pick up.
Thanks,
Joe

997,Vintage apt  shared yard  Wifi,"
 It`s the first floor of an owner-occupied three-family. I`m the owner and live on the second floor.
The apartment has high ceilings, six windows, two entrances, four big rooms, bathroom with shower, and a large closet. It`s wider than most railroad apartments. I listed it last month, but the photos were nicer than the apartment, so I took it off the market and improved it so much that now the apartment is nicer than the photos. (These are the old images. Kitchen floor has been prettied-up. Tenant may choose final finish - poly or paint.) However, please note that it`s not a ""renovated"" apartment.
The third-floor tenants are gung-ho about growing a garden in the neglected backyard. There`s plenty of room for more gardeners or landscape artists :)
The apartment is spacious, but like most railroad apartments hereabouts, it`s not a ""true"" two bedroom. However, there are several ways to create private space for each of two roommates.
I MAY allow some airbnb -- but only the legal way and subject to my vetting and rules. We would cooperate and share the income. My apartment has a similar layout and I`ve been wanting to do airbnb myself -- so, I`ve already thought out a lot of the angles. When I offered this possibility for the third floor, some people went kinda nuts and scared me off the idea. So, I want to be clear that this is an opportunity, NOT a right.
The neighborhood is sweet, quiet, and very safe. There`s a laundromat on the corner and many coffee shops, restaurants, and mom &amp; pop grocers nearby. You can walk to Williamsburg in 15 minutes, join the excitement, and return to tranquility. The Nassau Ave. G-subway stop is about a half mile away and the Graham Ave. L stop is .9 mile`s away. The B48 bus stops at my corner and takes you straight to the Lorimer L-train. A taxi to or from Penn Station is about $22 + tip, less if you`re going downtown. But for local travel, in good weather, biking is best.
$2100/month. One month security + last month`s rent ($4200) upon signing of lease (this is a kind of credit check). First month`s rent upon move-in. I`m happy to give keys earlier so tenant(s) can help me w finishing touches, paint new colors &amp;/or ""customize"" before actual move-in -- but only if first month is paid.
Send me an e-mail that tells me a little about yourself(selves). If the B&amp;B idea interests you, a resum&eacute; would be helpful.
Cats are welcome. Dogs maybe.
