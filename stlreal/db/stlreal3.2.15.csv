 I have a beautiful 4-br, 3 full ba, 2,000 sq. ft. home to share. I will be renting out the downstairs master bedroom (biggest br in the house) with a huge walk-in closet, attached bathroom w/ shower, and another medium sized room for office/storage/workout. Also included is the large downstairs living room w/ fireplace. Cable and Wi/Fi and ALL UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED. There is another door at the end of the hall that you can close off to the rest of the house so you`ll have plenty of privacy. Rent will be $700.00 per month. $1400.00 down to move in-(first and last months rent). I am NOT a partyer and am lookin for the same. I do have a dog that stays in the back yard but may come inside durring very hot days and some of the winter so you must be pet friendly. If you have a pet as well-pets are negotiable. It is a great house, in a great neighborhood, with a nice big yard, and I am a very clean person. I would like to have someone in by the 1st. Of March.-if possible. Leases are also negotiable, I have been renting month to month, but I`d be open to a longer term lease for the right applicant. I have found some really good roomates so far on here, but both have moved on due to job offers/transfers and they were very happy here. If you are interested in looking at the place, please email me back with your name and a phone # where you can be reached or you can call me at

One of the first glamorous residential hotels in Kansas City, The Bellerive was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The Hotel`s club, the Casbah hosted entertainment legends such as Bob Hope, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and Jerry Lewis. The suites have been remodeled and combined to create spacious apartments while retaining the buildings charm and grandeur. Residents and guests are greeted by a beautiful marble lobby with a stunning sculpted ceiling. The Bellerive is centrally-located, just minutes away from Westport, the Plaza and Downtown. It is just a short walk to the metro busline and just minutes to major interstates.
We have around 25 apartment buildings on this street, so we can show you more than just this unit if this doesn`t fit your needs. All MAC properties are within roughly 3 minutes of Westport, 5 minutes of the Plaza, 7 Minutes from the downtown power and light district, and right up the street from Martini Corner.

 REMEDY : Pay in full before the rate increase or close the account 398 Long hours at the office I gladly took a look at her credit card statement and the very first thing I noticed, which almost floored me, is the interest rate she`s paying There is a lot of interest in 0% APR Balance Transfer credit cards because of the tremendous savings possibilities they offer This means that you will pay 0 APR for six months, nine months, or up to a year Pay off the smallest balance first with larger payments until the number of credit cards you have in debt is down to one ftc In this high-tech era of computers and machines, the purchasing power of people is mostly based on credit 502 The only thing that can improve your chances of getting approved is by improving your credit score and nothing else! You can do this by browsing the Internet to find a bank, credit union, or other reputable lender show is willing to help you set up a credit card processing account

Step foot on the worn marble floor as you make your way to the elevator.
 Enjoy great natural light beaming down on the beautiful well maintained hardwood floors. If closet space is important to you, exhale....loaded with plenty. Unique built in features, so that no two units in the building are exactly the same. The sunroom allows for great additional living space and still maintains a cozy temperature year round.
 Located across from the Block Cancer Survivors Park and within walking distance to all the magic of the Country Club Plaza.
 For your personal tour, please call Terri at Terra Management
